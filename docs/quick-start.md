# Quick Start

## Composer installation

Composer is the easiest way to install `php-macaroons` into a PHP application
since `php-macaroons` is fully PSR-4 compliant. The autoloader generated by
composer does the heavy lifting.

Simply run `composer require` in an existing composer project:

```bash
composer require immense/macaroons
```
